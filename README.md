# Smart Chat

This is a project to provide a simple text-based ui (console) to a `(S|M|L)LM`(Language Model; AI). You can talk like a chat to a trained model.

Currently, it uses [LLamaSharp](https://github.com/SciSharp/LLamaSharp) with CPU Backend and I tested with `Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-fp16.gguf` model, which can be downloaded at `https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-gguf`.
